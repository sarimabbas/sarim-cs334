To justify your game project

- use the idea of combinatorial creativity: you didnt want to come up with ssomethting entirely new but rather modify older concepts and ideas
- also justify that you *are* breakinng the 1:1 viewer/artist link by making the game rely on the useer's environment. this is completely new and never beenen done before
