## Ideation

I wanted to create a video game console. As a single person team, I wanted to create a game that would be of medium complexity to create and that would run smoothly on the Pi.

With the limited controls available, I thought about which game formats would work the best. I shortlisted two concepts:

1. An endless runner (think Flappy Bird, Temple Run, Jetpack Joyride etc.)
2. A duelling game where wizards can cast spells and put up defenses against other players and also the environment

The first idea has been attempted a lot, so I decided against it. Any meaningful addition of complexity (for e.g. I was thinking isometric terrain) would be too difficult to code up in Processing. 

So I decided to pursue the Duelling idea, which seemed relatively easy to code up and would also be a novel experience.
